-- there are 794 of them and inventing an id per string would put the burden on
-- whoever adds a secret rather than on whoever translates one.

-- So the English text is the key, the way gettext does it. A locale file maps
-- the English to its translation and anything unmapped renders as written, so a
-- half-finished translation degrades string by string instead of all at once,
-- and the data file needs no changes at all.
--
-- The tradeoff: editing an English string orphans its translation. That is the
-- price of needing no keys, and tools/extract-strings.py re-runs to show which
-- strings are newly unmatched.
